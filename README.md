#Project name: AI-Powered Local Mobility & Farming Assistant for Semi-Urban India. 

#Description: An AI-powered farming assistant designed for hobbyist and small-scale farmers in semi-urban India. The system helps users make better crop, irrigation,
              and basic plant-health decisions using AI-driven recommendations based on soil parameters, weather data, and user inputs. The solution focuses on 
              affordability, simplicity, multilingual support, and decision assistance rather than full automation.
